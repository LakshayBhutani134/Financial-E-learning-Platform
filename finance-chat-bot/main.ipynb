Macro Trends  – Keeping a genera l tab on the macroeconomic trend is a great way \\nof identifying good stocks. Here is an illustration of the same – As of today there is a \\ngreat push for infrastructure projects in India. An obvious beneficiary of this push \\nwould be the cement companies oper ating in India. Hence, I would look through all \\nthe cement companies and apply the checklist to identify which amongst all the \\ncement companies are well positioned to leverage this macro trend.  \\n4. Sectoral Trends  – This is sector specific. One needs to track sectors to identify \\nemerging trends and companies within the sector that can benefit from it. For \\nexample the non alcoholic beverages market is a very traditional sector. Mainly, \\nthree kinds of products are sold and they are coffee, tea, and packaged water . \\nHence, most of the companies manufacture and sell just these three products. \\nHowever there is a slight shift in the consumer taste these days – the market for \\nenergy drink is opening up and it seems to be promising. Hence the investor may \\nwant to check f or companies within the sector that is best positioned to leverage \\nthis change and adapt to it.  \\n5. Special Situation – This is a slightly complicated way of generating a stock idea. \\nOne has to follow companies, company related news, company events etc to \\ngene rate an idea based on special situation. One example that I distinctly remember \\nwas that of Cox & Kings. You may know that Cox & Kings is one of the largest and \\nthe oldest tour operator in India. In late 2013, the company announced inclusion of \\nMr.Keki Mis try (from HDFC Bank) to its advisory board. Corporate India has an \\nimmense respect for him as he is known to be a very transparent and efficient \\nbusiness professional. A colleague of mine was convinced that Cox & Kings would \\nbenefit significantly with Mr. Keki Mistry on its board. This alone acted as a primary \\ntrigger for my colleague to investigate the stock further. Upon further research my \\ncolleague happily invested in Cox & Kings Limited. Good for my him, as I write this \\ntoday I know he is sitting on a 200% gain  \\n6. Circle of Competence – This is where you leverage your professional skills to \\nidentify stock ideas. This is a highly recommended technique for a newbie investor. \\nThis method requires you to identify stocks within your professional domain. For \\nexample, if you are a medical professional your circle of competence would be the \\nhealthcare industry. You will probably be a better person to understand that \\nindustry than a stock broker or an equity research analyst. All you need to do is \\nidentify which are  the listed companies in this space and pick the best based on \\nyour assessment. Likewise if you are banker, you will probably know more about \\nbanks than the others do. So, leverage your circle of competence to pick your \\ninvestments.  \\nThe point is that the t rigger for investigating stocks may come from any source. In \\nfact, as and when you feel a particular stock looks interesting, just add it to your list. \\nThis list over time will be your ‘watch list’.

When an \\ninvestor wishes to invest in a business for the long term (say 3 – 5 years) it becomes \\nextremely essential to understand the business from various perspectives. It is \\ncritical for an investor to separate the daily short term noise in the stock prices and \\nconcentrate on the u nderlying business performance. Over the long term, the stock \\nprices of a fundamentally strong company tend to appreciate, thereby creating \\nwealth for its investors.  \\nWe have many such examples in the Indian market. To name a few, one can think of \\ncompanies  such as Infosys Limited, TCS Limited, Page Industries, Eicher Motors, \\nBosch India, Nestle India, TTK Prestige etc. Each of these companies have delivered \\non an average over 20% compounded annual growth return (CAGR) year on year for \\nover 10 years. To give  you a perspective, at a 20% CAGR the investor would double \\nhis money in roughly about 3.5 years. Higher the CAGR faster is the wealth creation \\nprocess. Some companies such as Bosch India Limited have delivered close to 30% \\nCAGR. Therefore, you can imagine  the magnitude, and the speed at which wealth is \\ncreated if one would invest in fundamentally strong companies.  \\n1', metadata={'source': 'D:/Project/llm/data/Module 3_Fundamental Analysis.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

It is a common misconception that only chartered \\naccountants and professionals from a commerce background can be good \\nfundamental analysts. This is not true at all. A fundamental analyst just adds 2 and 2 \\nto ensure it sums up to 4. To become a fundam ental analyst you will need few basic \\nskills:  \\n1. Understanding the basic financial statements  \\n2. Understand businesses with respect to the industry in which it operates  \\n3.

It he lps you time \\nthe market for a better entry and exit. However TA is not an effective approach to \\ncreate wealth. Wealth is created only by making intelligent long term investments. \\nHowever, both TA & FA must coexist in your market strategy.

       " Document(page_content='Let us say a market participant identifies Eicher motors as a fundamentally strong \\nstock to invest, and therefore invests his money in the stock in the year 2006. As you \\ncan see the stock made a relatively negligible move between 2006 and 2010. The \\nreal move in Eicher Motors started only from 2010. This also means FA based \\ninvestment in Eicher Motors did not give the investor any meaningful return \\nbetween 2006 and 2010. The market participant woul d have been better off taking \\nshort term trades during this time. Technical Analysis helps the investor in taking \\nshort term trading bets. Hence both TA & FA should coexist as a part of your market \\nstrategy. In fact, this leads us to an important capital a llocation strategy called “The \\nCore Satellite Strategy”.  \\nLet us say, a market participant has a corpus of Rs.500,000/ -. This corpus can be \\nsplit into two unequal portions, for example the split can be 60 – 40. The 60% of \\ncapital which is Rs.300,000/ - can b e invested for a long term period in fundamentally \\nstrong companies. This 60% of the investment makes up the core of the portfolio. \\nOne can expect the core portfolio to grow at a rate of at least 12% to 15% CAGR year \\non year basis.  \\nThe balance 40% of the a mount, which is Rs.200,000/ - can be utilized for active short \\nterm trading using Technical Analysis technique on equity, futures, and options.

Is it \\nnot obvious that the share price of such companies would appreciate? In some \\nsituations the price appreciat ion may delay (recall the Eicher Motors chart from \\nprevious chapter), but it certainly will always appreciate. This has happened over \\nand over again across markets in the world, including India.  \\nAn investment in a good company defined by  investable grade a ttributes  will \\nalways yield results.

What does that mean?  \\nLike we discussed briefly in the previous chapter, an investible grade company has  a \\nfew distinguishable characteristics. These characteristics can be classified under two \\nheads namely the ‘Qualitative aspect’ and the ‘Quantitative aspects’. The process of \\nevaluating a fundamentally strong company includes a study of both these aspects.  \\nIn fact in my personal investment practice, I give the qualitative aspects a little more \\nimportance over the quantitative aspects.  \\nThe Qualitative aspect  mainly involves understanding the non numeric aspects of \\nthe business. This includes many factors such as:  \\n1. Management’s background  – Who are they, their background, experience, \\neducation,  do they have the merit to run the business, any criminal cases against \\nthe promoters etc  \\n2. Business ethics  – is the management involved in scams, bribery, unfair busin ess \\npractices  \\n3. Corporate governance  – Appointment of directors, organization structure, \\ntransparency etc  \\n4. Minority shareholders  – How does the management treat minority shareholders, \\ndo they consider their interest while taking corporate actions  \\n5. Share transa ctions  – Is the management buying/selling shares of the company \\nthrough clandestine promoter groups  \\n6. Related party transactions  – Is the company tendering financial favors to known \\nentities such as promoter’s relatives, friends, vendors etc at the cost of the \\nshareholders funds?  \\n7. Salaries paid to promoters  – Is the management paying themselves a hefty salary, \\nusually a percentage of profits  \\n8. Operator activity in stocks  – Does the stock price display unusual price behavior \\nespecially at a time when the promote r is transacting in the shares  \\n11', metadata={'source': 'D:/Project/llm/data/Module 3_Fundamental Analysis.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",

Political affiliation  – Is the company or its promoters too close to a political party ? \\nDoes the business require constant political support?  \\n11. Promoter lifestyle – Are the promoters too flamboyant and loud about their \\nlifestyle? Do they like to display their wealth?  \\nA red flag is raised when any of the factors mentioned above do not fall in the right \\nplace. For example, if a company undertakes too many related party transactions \\nthen it would send a signal of favoritism and malpractice by the company. This is \\nnot good in the long run. So even if the company has great profit margins, \\nmalpracti ce is not acceptable. It would only be a matter of time before the market \\ndiscovers matters pertaining to ‘related party transactions’ and punishes the \\ncompany by bringing the stock price lower.

The annual report is published by the \\nend of the Financial Year, and all the data made available in the annual report is \\ndated to 31st March. The AR is usually available on the company’s website (in the \\ninvestors section) as a PDF document or one can contact the company to get a hard \\ncopy of the same.  \\nSince the annual report is published by the company, whatever is mentioned in the \\nAR is assumed to be official. Hence, any misrepresentation of facts in the annual \\nreport can be held against the company. To give you a perspective, AR cont ains the \\nauditor’s certificates (signed, dated, and sealed) certifying the sanctity of the \\nfinancial data included in the annual report.  \\nPotential investors and the present shareholders are the primary audience for the \\nannual report.   Annual reports should  provide the most pertinent information to an \\ninvestor and should also communicate the company’s primary message.

For example the company may like to include ‘depreciation’ in the expense \\nside of P&L, but the media website may l ike to include it under a separate header. \\nWhile this would not impact the overall numbers, it does interrupt the overall \\nsequencing of data.  \\n3.2 – What to look for in an Annual Report?  \\nThe annual report has many sections that contain useful information ab out the \\ncompany. One has to be careful while going through the annual report as there is a \\nvery thin line between the facts presented by the company and the marketing \\ncontent that the company wants you to read.  \\nLet us briefly go through the various section s of an annual report and understand \\nwhat the company is trying to communicate in the AR.

To help you \\nunderstand this better, I have taken the example of CRISIL Limited’s shareholding \\nstructure. You can find the same in CRISIL’s annual re port.

The balance 49% of shares of CRISIL is held by Public and other Financial institutions  \\n3. However, S&P itself is 100% subsidiary of another company called ‘The McGraw -Hill \\nCompanies’  \\n1.

From the maker’s perspective  \\n2. From the us er’s perspective  \\nA maker prepares the financial statements. He is typically a person with an \\naccounting background. His job involves preparing ledger entries, matching bills and \\nreceipts, tallying the inflows versus the outflows, auditing etc. The final ob jective of \\nthe is to prepare transparent financial statements which best represents the true \\nfinancial position of the company. To prepare such a financial statement certain \\nskills are required, usually these skills are developed through the rigor of a \\nChartered Accountant’s training program.  \\nThe user on the other hand just needs to be in a position to understand what the \\nmaker has prepared. He is just the user of the financial statements. He need not \\nreally know the details of the journal entries or the au dit procedure.

We will \\ndiscuss more about the debt and related matters when we take up the chapter on \\nthe balance sheet later.  \\nFollowing the finance cost the next line item is “D epreciation and Amortization” \\ncosts which stand at Rs.64.5 Crs. To understand depreciation and amortization we \\nneed to understand the concept of tangible and intangible assets.  \\nA tangible asset is one which has a physical form and provides an economic valu e to \\nthe company. For example a laptop, a printer, a car, plants, machinery, buildings etc.  \\nAn intangible asset is something that does not have a physical form but still \\nprovides an economic value to the company such as brand value, trademarks, \\ncopyrights,  patents, franchises, customer lists etc.  \\nAn asset (tangible or intangible) has to be depreciated over its useful life. Useful life \\nis defined as the period during which the asset can provide economic benefit to the \\ncompany. For example the useful life of a laptop could be 4 years. Let us \\nunderstand depreciation better with the help of the following example.  \\nZerodha, a stock broking firm generates Rs.100,000/ - from the stock broking \\nbusiness. However Zerodha incurred an expense of Rs.65,000/ - towards the \\npurchase of a high performance computer server. The economic life (useful life) of \\nthe server is expected to be 5 years. Now if you were to look into the earning \\ncapability of Zerodha it appears that on one hand Zerodha earned Rs.100,000/ - and \\non the other h and spent Rs.65,000/ - and therefore retained just Rs.35,000/ -. This \\nskews the earnings data for the current year and does not really reflect the true \\nearning capability of the company.  \\nRemember the asset even though purchased this year, would continue to p rovide \\neconomic benefits over its useful life. Hence it makes sense to spread the cost of \\nacquiring the asset over its useful life. This is called depreciation. This means \\ninstead of showing an upfront lump sum expense (towards purchase of an asset), \\nthe c ompany can show a smaller amount spread across the useful life of an asset.  \\nThus Rs.65,000/ - will be spread across the useful life of the server, which is 5. Hence \\n65,000/ 5 = Rs.13,000/ - would be depreciated every year over the next five years. By \\ndepreci ating the asset, we are spreading the upfront cost. Hence after the \\ndepreciation computation, Zerodha would now show its earrings as Rs.100,000 – \\nRs.13,000 = Rs.87,000/ -. \\nWe can do a similar exercise for non tangible assets. The depreciation equivalent for  \\nnon tangible assets is called amortization.  \\nNow here is an important idea – Zerodha depreciates the cost of acquiring an asset \\nover its useful life. However, in reality there is an actual outflow of Rs.65,000/ - paid \\n36', metadata={'source': 'D:/Project/llm/data/Module 3_Fundamental Analysis.pdf', 'page': 36}),\n",

Notice how the previous year balance sheet number is added up to this year’s number. This \\nhighlights the fact that the balance sheet is prepared on a flow basis, addi ng the carrying \\nforward numbers year on year  \\n2. Previous year’s balance plus this year’s profit adds up to Rs.1197.2 Crs. The \\ncompany can choose to apportion this money for various purposes.  \\n1. The first thing a company does is it transfers some money from the s urplus to general reserves \\nso that it will come handy for future use. They have transferred close to Rs.36.7 Crs for this \\npurpose  \\n2. After transferring to general reserves they have distributed Rs.55.1 Crs as dividends over which \\nthey have to pay Rs.9.3 Crs a s dividend distribution taxes.  \\n3. After making the necessary apportions the company has Rs.1095.9 Crs as surplus as \\nclosing balance.

Subsequently in this module we \\nwill look into the financial ratios.  \\nLet us look into the note associated with ‘Long term borrowings’:  \\n \\nFrom the note it is quite clear that the ‘Long term borrowings’ is in the form of \\n‘interest free sales tax deferment’. To understand what interest free sales tax \\ndeferment really means, the company has explained just below the note (I have \\nhighlighted the same in a red box). It appears to be some sort of tax incentive from \\nthe state government. The company plans to settle this amount over a period of 14 \\nyears.  \\nYou will find that there are many companies which do not have long term \\nborrowings (debt). While it is a good to know that the company has no debt, you \\nmust also question as to why there is no debt? Is  it because the banks are refusing \\nto lend to the company? or is it because the company is not taking initiatives to \\nexpand their business operations. Of course, we will deal with the analysis part of \\nthe balance sheet later in the module.  \\nDo recollect, we  looked at ‘Finance Cost’ as a line item when we looked at the P&L \\nstatement. If the debt of the company is high, then the finance cost will also be high.  \\nThe next line item within the non -current liability is ‘ Deferred Tax Liability’ . The \\ndeferred tax lia bility is basically a provision for future tax payments. The company \\nforesees a situation where it may have to pay additional taxes in the future; hence \\nthey set aside some funds for this purpose. Why do you think the company would \\nput itself in a situatio n where it has to pay more taxes for the current year at some \\npoint in the future?  \\nWell this happens because of the difference in the way depreciation is treated as \\nper Company’s act and Income tax. We will not get into this aspect as we will digress \\nfrom our objective of becoming users of financial statements. But do remember, \\ndeferred tax liability arises due to the treatment of depreciation.  \\n50', metadata={'source': 'D:/Project/llm/data/Module 3_Fundamental Analysis.pdf', 'page': 50}),\n",

A Balance sheet also called the Statement of Financial Position is prepared on a flow \\nbasis which depicts the financial  position of the company at any given point in time. \\nIt is a statement which shows what the company owns ( assets) and what the \\ncompany owes (liabilities)  \\n2. A business will generally need a balance sheet when it seeks investors, applies for \\nloans, submits ta xes etc.  \\n3. Balance sheet equation is Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders’ Equity  \\n4. Liabilities are obligations or debts of a business from past transactions and Share \\ncapital is number of shares * face value  \\n5. Reserves are the funds earmarked for a specific purp ose, which the company \\nintends to use in future  \\n6. Surplus is where the profits of the company reside. This is one of the points where \\nthe balance sheet and the P&L interact. Dividends are paid out of the surplus  \\n7. Shareholders’ equity = Share capital + Reserve s + Surplus. Equity is the claim of the \\nowners on the assets of the company. It represents the assets that remain after \\ndeducting the liabilities. If you rearrange the Balance Sheet equation, Equity = \\nAssets – Liabilities.  \\n8. Non -current liabilities or the lo ng term liabilities are obligations which are expected \\nto be settled in not less than 365 days or 12 months of the balance sheet date  \\n9. Deferred tax liabilities arise due to the discrepancy in the way the depreciation is \\ntreated.

This value is called the \\nDepreciation expense, which is shown in the Profit and Loss account and the \\nBalance Sheet.  \\nAll the assets should be depreciated over its useful life.

However, we will now understand how \\nthe line items in the P&L and the Balance Sheet are connected to each other.  \\nTo begin with, consider the  Revenue from Sales . When a company makes a sale it \\nincurs expenses. For example if the co mpany undertakes an advertisement \\ncampaign to spread awareness about its products, then naturally the company has \\nto spend cash  on the campaign. The money spent tends to decrease the cash \\nbalance. Also, if the company makes a sale on credit, the  Receivable s (Accounts \\nReceivables) go higher.  \\nOperating expenses  includes purchase of raw material, finished goods and other \\nsimilar expenses.

Two, the  Inventory  level also \\ngets affected. Whether the inventory value is high or low, depends on how much \\ntime the company needs to sell its products.  \\nWhen companies purchase Tangible assets or invest in Brand building exercises \\n(Intangible assets) the company spreads the purchase value of the asset over the \\neconomic useful life of the asset.

The money that \\ngoes towards financing the debt is called the  Finance Cost/Borrowing Cost .

Well, the answer is both a yes and a no.  \\nConsider the following scenario.  \\nAssume a simple coffee shop selling coffee and short eats. All the sales the shop \\ndoes is mostly on cash basis, meaning if a  customer wants to have a cup of coffee \\nand a snack, he needs to have enough money to buy what he wants. Going by that \\non a particular day, assume the shop manages to sell Rs.2,500/ - worth of coffee and \\nRs.3,000/ - worth of snacks. It is evident that the sh op’s income is Rs.5,500/ - for that \\nday. Rs.5,500/ - is reported as revenues in P&L, and there is no ambiguity with this.  \\nNow think about another business that sells laptops. For sake of simplicity, let us \\nassume that the shop sells only 1 type of laptop at a standard fixed rate of \\nRs.25,000/ - per laptop.

We will now focus our attention on analyzing these financial \\nstatements. The best way to analyze the financial statements is by studying the \\n‘Financial Ratios’. The theory of financial ratios was made popular by Benjamin \\nGraham, who is popularly known as the father of fundamental analysis. Financial \\nratios help in interpreting the results, and allows comparison with previous years \\nand other companies in the same industry.  \\nA typical finan cial ratio utilizes data from the financial statement to compute its \\nvalue. Before we start understanding the financial ratios, we need to be aware of \\ncertain attributes of the financial ratios.  \\nOn its own merit, the financial ratio of a company conveys ve ry little information. \\nFor instance, assume Ultratech Cements Limited has a profit margin of 15%, how \\nuseful do you think this information is? Well, not much really. 15% profit margin is \\ngood, but how would I know if it is the best?  \\nHowever, assume you fig ure out ACC Cement’s profit margin is 12%. Now, as we \\ncomparing two similar companies, comparing the profitability makes sense. Clearly, \\nUltratech Cements Limited seems to be a more profitable company between the \\ntwo. The point that I am trying to drive ac ross is that more often than not, Financial \\nRatios on its own is quite mute. The ratio makes sense only when you compare the \\nratio with another company of a similar size or when you look into the trend of the \\nfinancial ratio. This means that once the ratio  is computed the ratio has to be \\nanalyzed (either by comparison or tracking the ratio’s historical trend) to get the \\nbest possible inference.  \\nAlso, here is something that you need to be aware off while computing ratios. \\nAccounting policies may vary across companies and across different financial years. \\nA fundamental analyst should be cognizant of this fact and should adjust the data \\naccordingly, before computing the financial ratio.  \\n78', metadata={'source': 'D:/Project/llm/data/Module 3_Fundamental Analysis.pdf', 'page': 78}),\n",

In \\nsimpler words, the valuation ratio compares the cost of a security with the perks of \\nowning the stock.  \\n \\nThe Operating Ratios , also called the ‘Activity Ratios’ measures the efficiency at \\nwhich a business can convert its as sets (both current and noncurrent) into \\nrevenues. This ratio helps us understand how efficient the management of the \\ncompany is. For this reason, Operating Ratios are sometimes called the \\n‘Management Ratios’.  \\nStrictly speaking, ratios (irrespective of the category it belongs to) convey a certain \\nmessage, usually related to the financial position of the company.

Going with this, a 16.3% EBITDA margin conveys \\nvery little information.  \\nTo makes some sense of the EBITDA margin, let us look at Amara Raja’s EBITDA \\nmargin trend for the last 4 years, (all numbers in Rs Crs, except EBITDA margin):  \\nYear Operating Revenues  Operating Expense  EBITDA  EBITDA Margin  \\n2011  1761  1504  257 14.6%  \\n2012  2364  2025  340 14.4%  \\n2013  2959  2508  451 15.2%  \\n2014  3437  2876  560 16.3%  \\nIt appears that ARBL has maintained its EBITDA at an average of 15%, and in fact on \\na closer look it is clear the EBITDA margin is increasing.

The use of leverage (debt) is like a double edged sword.  \\nWell managed companies seek debt if they foresee a situation where, they can \\ndeploy the debt funds in an environ ment which generates a higher return in \\ncontrast to the interest payments the company has to makes to service its debt. Do \\nrecollect a judicious use of debt to finance assets also increases the return on \\nequity.  \\nHowever if a company takes on too much debt,  then the interest paid to service the \\ndebt eats into the profit share of the shareholders. Hence there is a very thin line \\nthat separates the good and the bad debt. Leverage ratios mainly deal with the \\noverall extent of the company’s debt, and help us und erstand the company’s \\nfinancial leverage better.  \\nWe will be looking into the following leverage ratios:  \\n1.

I have chosen Jain Irrigation Systems Limited (JISL), \\nI would encourage you calculate the ratios for a company of your choice.  \\nInterest Coverage Ratio:  \\nThe interest coverage ratio is also referred to as debt service ratio or the debt \\nservice coverage ratio. The interest coverage ratio helps us understand how much \\nthe company is earning relative to the interest burden of the company . This ratio \\nhelps us interpret how easily a company can pay its interest payments. For example, \\nif the company has an interest burden of Rs.100 versus an income of Rs.400, then \\nwe clearly know that the company has sufficient funds to service its debt.

In the context of \\ninvestments, ‘something’ refers to the price of a stock. When making an investment \\ndecision, irrespective of how attractive the business appears, what matters finally is \\nthe valuation of the business. Valuations dictate the price you pay to acquire a \\nbusiness. Sometimes, a mediocre business at a ridiculously cheap valuation may be \\na great investment option as opposed to an exciting business with an extremely \\nhigh valuation.  \\nThe valuation ratios help us develop a sense on how the stock price is valued by the \\nmarket participants. These ratios help us understand the attractiveness of the stock \\nprice from an investment perspective. The point of valuation ratios is to compare \\nthe price of a stock viz a viz the benefits of owning it. Like all the other ratios we had \\nlooked at, the valuation ratios of a company should be evaluated alongside the \\ncompany’s competitors.  \\n \\nValuation ratios are usually computed as a ratio of the company’s share price to an \\naspect of its financial performance. We will be looking at the following three \\nimportant valuation ratios:  \\n1. Price to Sales (P/S) Ratio  \\n2. Price to Book Value (P/BV) Ratio and  \\n119', metadata={'source': 'D:/Project/llm/data/Module 3_Fundamental Analysis.pdf', 'page': 119}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='3. Price to Earnings (P/E) Ratio  \\nContinuing with the Amara R aja Batteries Limited (ARBL) example, let us implement \\nthese ratios to see how ARBL fares. The stock price of ARBL is a vital input used to \\ncalculate the valuation ratios. As I write this chapter on 28th of Oct 2014, ARBL is \\ntrading at Rs.661 per share.  \\nWe also need the total number of shares outstanding in ARBL to calculate the above \\nratios. If you recollect, we have calculated the same in chapter 6. The total number \\nof shares outstanding is 17,08,12,500 or 17.081Crs  \\nPrice to Sales (P/S) Ratio  \\nIn many case s, investors may use sales instead of earnings to value their \\ninvestments. The earnings figure may not be true as some companies might be \\nexperiencing a cyclical low in their earning cycle. Additionally due to some \\naccounting rules, a profitable company ma y seem to have no earnings at all, due to \\nthe huge write offs applicable to that industry. So, investors would prefer to use this \\nratio. This ratio compares the stock price of the company with the company’s sales \\nper share. The formula to calculate the P/S  ratio is:  \\nPrice to sales ratio = Current Share Price / Sales per Share  \\nLet us calculate the same for ARBL. We will take up the denominator first:  \\nSales per share = Total Revenues / Total number of shares  \\nWe know from ARBL’s P&L statement the:  \\nTotal Revenu e = Rs.3482 Crs  \\nNumber of Shares = 17.081 Crs  \\nSales per share = 3482 / 17.081  \\nTherefore the Sales per share = Rs. 203.86  \\nThis means for every share outstanding, ARBL does Rs.203.86 worth of sales.  \\nPrice to Sales Ratio = 661 / 203.86  \\n= 3.24x or 3.24 times  \\nA P/S ratio of 3.24 times indicates that, for every Rs.1 of sales, the stock is valued \\nRs.3.24 times higher. Obviously, higher the P/S ratio, higher is the valuation of the \\nfirm. One has to compare the P/S ratio with its competitors in the industry to get a  \\nfair sense of how expensive or cheap the stock is.  \\n120', metadata={'source': 'D:/Project/llm/data/Module 3_Fundamental Analysis.pdf', 'page': 120}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Here is something that you need to remember while calculating the P/S ratio. \\nAssume there are two companies (Company A and Company B) selling the same \\nproduct. Both the companies generate a revenue of Rs.1000/ -each. However, \\nCompany A retains Rs.250 as PAT and Company B retains Rs.150 as PAT. In this \\ncase, Company A has a profit margin of 25% versus Company B’s which has a 15% \\nprofit margin. Hence the sales of Company A is more valuable than the sales o f \\nCompany B. Hence if Company A is trading at a higher P/S, then the valuation \\nmaybe justified, simply because every rupee of sales Company A generates, a higher \\nprofit is retained.  \\nHence whenever you feel a particular company is trading at a higher valuat ion from \\nthe P/S ratio perspective, do remember to check the profit margin for cues.  \\nPrice to Book Value (P/BV) Ratio  \\nBefore we understand the Price to Book Value ratio, we need to understand what \\nthe term ‘Book Value’ means.  \\nConsider a situation where the  company has to close down its business and \\nliquidate all its assets. What is the minimum value the company receives upon \\nliquidation? The answer to this lies in the “Book Value” of the firm.  \\nThe “Book Value” of a firm is simply the amount of money left on  table after the \\ncompany pays off its obligations. Consider the book value as the salvage value of \\nthe company. Suppose the book value of a company is Rs.200Crs, then this is the \\namount of money the company can expect to receive after it sells everything a nd \\nsettles its debts. Usually the book value is expressed on a per share basis. For \\nexample, if the book value per share is Rs.60, then Rs.60 per share is what the \\nshareholder can expect in case the company decides to liquidate. The ‘Book Value’ \\n(BV) can b e calculated as follows:  \\nBV = [Share Capital + Reserves (excluding revaluation reserves) / Total Number \\nof shares]  \\nLet us calculate the same for ARBL:  \\nFrom ARBL’s balance sheet we know:  \\nShare Capital = Rs.17.1 Crs  \\nReserves = Rs.1345.6 Crs  \\nRevaluation Reser ves = 0  \\nNumber of shares: 17.081  \\nHence the Book Value per share = [17.1+1345.6 – 0] / 17.081  \\n121', metadata={'source': 'D:/Project/llm/data/Module 3_Fundamental Analysis.pdf', 'page': 121}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='= Rs.79.8 per share  \\nThis means if ARBL were to liquidate all its assets and pay off its debt, Rs.79.8 per \\nshares is what the shareholders can expect.  \\nMoving ahead,  if we divide the current market price of the stock by the book value \\nper share, we will get the price to the book value of the firm. The P/BV indicates how \\nmany times the stock is trading over and above the book value of the firm. Clearly \\nthe higher the r atio, the more expensive the stock is.  \\nLet us calculate this for ARBL. We know:  \\nStock price of ARBL = Rs.661 per share  \\nBV of ARBL = 79.8 per share  \\nP/BV = 661/79.8  \\n= 8.3x or 8.3 times  \\nThis means ARBL is trading over 8.3 times its book value.  \\nA high ratio co uld indicate the firm is overvalued relative to the equity/ book value \\nof the company. A low ratio could indicate the company is undervalued relative to \\nthe equity/ book value of the company.  \\nPrice to Earning (P/E) Ratio  \\nThe Price to Earnings ratio is perh aps the most popular financial ratio. Everybody \\nlikes to check the P/E of a stock. Because of the popularity the P/E ratio enjoys, it is \\noften considered the ‘financial ratio superstar’.  \\nThe P/E of a stock is calculated by dividing the  current stock price  by the  Earning \\nPer share  (EPS). Before we proceed further to understand the PE ratio, let us \\nunderstand what “Earnings per Share” (EPS) stands for.  \\nEPS measures the profitability of a company on a per share basis. For example \\nassume a certain company with 1000 shares outstanding generates a profit of \\nRs.200000/ -.  Then the earnings on a per share basis would be:  \\n=200000 / 1000  \\n= Rs.200 per share.  \\nHence the EPS gives us a sense of the profits generated on a per share basis. \\nClearly, higher the EPS, better it  is for its shareholders.  \\nIf you divide the current market price with EPS we get the Price to Earnings ratio of a \\nfirm.

Why do you \\nthink this happened?  \\nClearly, the P/E Ratio jumped because of the increase in the stock price. As we know \\nthe stock price of a company increases when the expectations from the company \\nincreases.  \\nRemember, P/E Rat io is calculated with ‘earnings’ in its denominator. While looking \\nat the P/E ratio, do remember the following key points:  \\n1. P/E indicates how expensive or cheap the stock is trading at. Never buy stocks that \\nare trading at high valuations. I personally do n ot like to buy stocks that are trading \\nbeyond 25 or at the most 30 times its earnings, irrespective of the company and the \\nsector it belongs to  \\n2.

These chapters have laid the foundation \\nto the final objective of this module which is – To use fundamental analysis to \\nidentify the stocks to invest. If you recollec t in the earlier chapters, we had discussed \\nabout investable grade attributes. Investable grade attributes simply define the \\nprerequisites of a company that needs to be validated before making an investment \\ndecision.  Think of the investable grade attribut es as a checklist based on the \\nfundamentals of the company. A company that satisfies most of the items in the \\nchecklist, is considered investment worthy.  \\nNow this is where few differences come up. For instance, what I consider as an \\ninvestable grade attrib ute may not be so important to you. For example – I may pay \\na lot of attention to corporate governance but another investor may choose not pay \\nso much attention to corporate governance. He could simply brush it off saying “all \\ncompanies have shades of grey , as long as the numbers add up I am fine investing \\nin the company”.  \\nSo the point is, there is no prescribed checklist. Each investor has to build his own \\nchecklist based on his investment experience. However, one has to ensure that each \\nitem on the checkl ist is qualified based on sound logic. Later in this chapter, I will \\nshare a checklist that I think is reasonably well curated. You could take pointers \\nfrom this checklist, if you are starting out fresh. We will keep this checklist as a \\nguideline and proce ed further in this module.  \\n127', metadata={'source': 'D:/Project/llm/data/Module 3_Fundamental Analysis.pdf', 'page': 127}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='12.2 – Generating a stock idea  \\nNow before we proceed further and generate a checklist, we must address a more \\nbasic issue. The process of investing requires us to first select a stock that looks \\ninteresting. After selecting the  stock we must subject it to the checklist to figure out \\nif the stock matches all the checklist criteria, if it does we invest, else we look for \\nother opportunities.  \\nSo in the first place, how do we even select a stock that looks interesting? In other \\nwords, how do we generate a list of stocks that seems interesting enough to \\ninvestigate further? Well, there are a few methods to do this – \\n1. General Observation  – This may sound rudimentary, but believe me this is one of \\nthe best ways to develop a stock ide a. All you need to do is keep your eyes and ears \\nopen and observe the economic activity around you. Observe what people are \\nbuying and selling, see what products are being consumed, keep an eye on the \\nneighborhood to see what people are talking about. In f act Peter Lynch, one of the \\nmost illustrious Wall Street investor advocates this method in his book “One up on \\nWall Street”. Personally I have used this method to pick some of my investments – \\nPVR Cinemas Ltd (because I noticed PVR multiplexes mushrooming in the City), \\nCummins India Limited (because I noticed most of the buildings had a Cummins \\ndiesel generator in their premises), and Info Edge Limited (Info Edge owns \\nnaukri.com, which is probably the most preferred job portal).  \\n2. Stock screener  – A stock scr eener helps to screen for stocks based on the \\nparameters you define and therefore helps investors perform quality stock analysis \\n.For example you can use a stock screener to identify stocks that have a ROE of 25% \\nalong with PAT margins of 20%. A stock scre ener is very helpful tool when you want \\nto shortlist a handful of investment ideas from a big basket of stocks. There are \\n128', metadata={'source': 'D:/Project/llm/data/Module 3_Fundamental Analysis.pdf', 'page': 128}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='many stock screeners available; I personally like the Google finance’s stock screener \\nand screener.in.  \\n3. Macro Trends  – Keeping a genera l tab on the macroeconomic trend is a great way \\nof identifying good stocks. Here is an illustration of the same – As of today there is a \\ngreat push for infrastructure projects in India. An obvious beneficiary of this push \\nwould be the cement companies oper ating in India. Hence, I would look through all \\nthe cement companies and apply the checklist to identify which amongst all the \\ncement companies are well positioned to leverage this macro trend.  \\n4. Sectoral Trends  – This is sector specific. One needs to track sectors to identify \\nemerging trends and companies within the sector that can benefit from it. For \\nexample the non alcoholic beverages market is a very traditional sector. Mainly, \\nthree kinds of products are sold and they are coffee, tea, and packaged water . \\nHence, most of the companies manufacture and sell just these three products. \\nHowever there is a slight shift in the consumer taste these days – the market for \\nenergy drink is opening up and it seems to be promising. Hence the investor may \\nwant to check f or companies within the sector that is best positioned to leverage \\nthis change and adapt to it.  \\n5. Special Situation – This is a slightly complicated way of generating a stock idea. \\nOne has to follow companies, company related news, company events etc to \\ngene rate an idea based on special situation. One example that I distinctly remember \\nwas that of Cox & Kings. You may know that Cox & Kings is one of the largest and \\nthe oldest tour operator in India. In late 2013, the company announced inclusion of \\nMr.Keki Mis try (from HDFC Bank) to its advisory board. Corporate India has an \\nimmense respect for him as he is known to be a very transparent and efficient \\nbusiness professional. A colleague of mine was convinced that Cox & Kings would \\nbenefit significantly with Mr. Keki Mistry on its board. This alone acted as a primary \\ntrigger for my colleague to investigate the stock further. Upon further research my \\ncolleague happily invested in Cox & Kings Limited. Good for my him, as I write this \\ntoday I know he is sitting on a 200% gain  \\n6. Circle of Competence – This is where you leverage your professional skills to \\nidentify stock ideas. This is a highly recommended technique for a newbie investor. \\nThis method requires you to identify stocks within your professional domain. For \\nexample, if you are a medical professional your circle of competence would be the \\nhealthcare industry. You will probably be a better person to understand that \\nindustry than a stock broker or an equity research analyst. All you need to do is \\nidentify which are  the listed companies in this space and pick the best based on \\nyour assessment. Likewise if you are banker, you will probably know more about \\nbanks than the others do. So, leverage your circle of competence to pick your \\ninvestments.  \\nThe point is that the t rigger for investigating stocks may come from any source. In \\nfact, as and when you feel a particular stock looks interesting, just add it to your list. \\nThis list over time will be your ‘watch list’. A very important thing to note here is that \\na stock may n ot satisfy the checklist items at a particular time, however as the time \\n129', metadata={'source': 'D:/Project/llm/data/Module 3_Fundamental Analysis.pdf', 'page': 129}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='progresses, as business dynamics change at some point it may match up to the \\nchecklist. Hence, it is important to evaluate the stocks in your watch list from time to \\ntime.  \\n \\n12.3 – The Moat  \\nAfter selecting a stock, one has to run the checklist to investigate the stock further. \\nThis is called the “Investment due diligence”. The due diligence process is very \\ncritical and one has to ensure maximum attention is paid to each and every aspec t \\nof this exercise. I will shortly present a checklist that I think is reasonable. But before \\nthat, we need to talk about ‘The Moat’.  \\nMoat (or economic moat) is a term that was popularized by Warren Buffet. The term \\nsimply refers to the company’s competiti ve advantage (over its competitors). A \\ncompany with a strong moat, ensures the company’s long term profits are \\nsafeguarded.  Of course the company should not only have a moat, but it should \\nalso be sustainable over a long period of time. A company which po ssesses wider \\nmoat characteristics (such as better brand name, pricing power, and better market \\nshare) would be more sustainable, and it would be difficult for the company’s rivals \\nto eat away its market share.  \\nTo understand moats, think of “Eicher Motors Limited”. Eicher Motors is a major \\nIndian automobile manufacturer. It manufactures commercial vehicles along with \\nthe iconic Royal Enfield bikes.

This helps us understand what the \\ncompany has to say about themselves.  \\nWhen it comes to my own investing practice, I usually like to invest in companies \\nwhere the competition is less and there is very little government intervention.

PVR and Cinemax merged leaving just 2 \\nlisted companies in that space. However, there are a few new players who have \\nentered this space now, hence it is time for me to re evaluate my investment thesis  \\nin PVR.  \\nOnce we are comfortable knowing the business, we move to  stage 2  i.e application \\nof the  checklist.  At this stage we get some performance related answers.

The \\nprice of a stock can be estimated by a valuation technique. Valuation per say helps \\nyou determine the ‘intrinsic value’ of the company.

The intrinsic value as per the DCF method is the evaluation of the \\n‘perceived stock price’ of a company, keeping all the future cash flows in \\nperspective.  \\nThe DCF model is m ade up of several concepts which are interwoven with one \\nanother.

       " Document(page_content='14.2 – The future cash flow  \\nThe concept of future cash flow is the crux of the DCF model. We will understand \\nthis with the  help of a simple example.  \\nAssume Vishal is a pizza vendor who serves the best pizza’s in town. His passion for \\nbaking pizzas leads him to an innovation. He invents an automatic pizza maker \\nwhich automatically bakes pizzas. All he has to do is, pour the in gredients required \\nfor making a pizza in the slots provided and within 5 minutes a fresh pizza pops out. \\nHe figures out that with this machine, he can earn an annual revenue of \\nRs.500,000/ - and the machine has a life span of 10 years.  \\nHis friend George is very impressed with Vishal’s pizza machine. So much so that, \\nGeorge offers to buy this machine from Vishal.  \\nNow here is a question for you – What do you think is the minimum price that \\nGeorge should pay Vishal to buy this machine? Well, obviously to answer  this \\nquestion we need to see how economically useful this machine is going to be for \\nGeorge. Assuming he buys this machine today (2014), over the next 10 years, the \\nmachine will earn him Rs.500,000/ - each year.  \\nHere is how George’s cash flow in the future  looks like – \\n2015  2016  2017  2018  2019  2020  2021  2022  2023  2024  \\n500,000  500,000  500,000  500,000  500,000  500,000  500,000  500,000  500,000  500,000  \\n148', metadata={'source': 'D:/Project/llm/data/Module 3_Fundamental Analysis.pdf', 'page': 148}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Do note, for the sake of convenience, I have assumed the machine will start \\ngenerating cash starting from 2015.  \\nClearly, George is going to earn Rs.50,00,000/ - (10 x 500,000) over the next 10 years, \\nafter which the machine is worthless. One thing is clear at this stage, whatever is the \\ncost of this machine, it cannot cost more than Rs.50,00,000/ -. Think about it – Does \\nit make sense to pay an entity a price which is more than the economic benefit it \\noffers?  \\nTo go ahead with our calculation, assume Vishal asks George to pay “Rs.X” towards \\nthe machine. At this stage, assume George has two options – either pay Rs. X and \\nbuy the machine or invest the same Rs.X in a fixed deposit scheme which not only \\nguarantees his capital but also pays him an interest of 8.5%. Let us assume that \\nGeorge decides to buy the machine instead of the fixed deposit alternative. This \\nimplies , George has foregone an opportunity to earn 8.5% risk free interest. This is \\nthe ‘opportunity cost’ for having decided to buy the machine.  \\nSo far, in our quest to price the automatic pizza maker we have deduced three \\ncrucial bits of information – \\n1. The total cash flow from the pizza maker over the next 10 years – Rs.50,00,000/ - \\n2. Since the total cash flow is known, it also implies that the cost of the machine \\nshould be less than the total cash flow from the machine  \\n3. The opportunity cost for buying the pizza  machine is, an investment option that \\nearns 8.5% interest  \\nKeeping the above three points in perspective, let us move ahead. We will now focus \\non the cash flows. We know that George will earn Rs.500,000/ - every year from the \\nmachine for the next 10 years. So think about this – George in 2014, is looking at the \\nfuture – \\n1. How much is the Rs.500,000/ - that he receives in 2016 worth in today’s terms?  \\n2. How much is the Rs.500,000/ - that he receives in 2018 worth in today’s terms?  \\n3. How much is the Rs.500,000/ - that h e receives in 2020 worth in today’s terms?  \\n4. To generalize, how much is the cash flow of the future worth in today’s terms?  \\nThe answer to these questions lies in the realms of the “ Time value of money ”. In \\nsimpler words, if I can calculate the value of all t he future cash flows from that \\nmachine in terms of today’s value, then I would be in a better situation to price that \\nmachine.  \\nPlease note – in the next section we will digress/move away from the pizza problem, \\nbut we will eventually get back to it.  \\n149', metadata={'source': 'D:/Project/llm/data/Module 3_Fundamental Analysis.pdf', 'page': 149}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='14.3 – Time Value of Money (TMV)  \\nTime value of money plays an extremely crucial role in finance. The TMV finds its \\napplication in almost all the financial concepts. Be it discounted cash flow analysis, \\nfinancial derivatives pricing, project finance, calculation of annuities etc, the time \\nvalue of money is applicable. Think of the ‘Time value of money’ as the engine of a \\ncar, with the car itself being the “Financial World”.  \\nThe concept of time value of money revolves around the fact that, the value of \\nmoney does n ot remain the same across time. Meaning, the value of Rs.100 today is \\nnot really Rs.100, 2 years from now. Inversely, the value of Rs.100, 2 years from now \\nis not really Rs.100 as of today. Whenever there is passage of time, there is an \\nelement of opportun ity. Money has to be accounted (adjusted) for that opportunity.  \\nIf we have to evaluate, what would be the value of money that we have today \\nsometime in the future, then we need to move the ‘money today’ through the \\nfuture. This is called the “ Future Value (FV)” of the money.  Likewise, if we have to \\nevaluate the value of money that we are expected to receive in the future in today’s \\nterms, then we have to move the future money back to today’s terms. This is called \\nthe “ Present Value (PV) ” of money.  \\nIn both the cases, as there is a passage of time, the money has to be adjusted for \\nthe opportunity cost. This adjustment is called “Compounding” when we have to \\ncalculate the future value of money. It is called “Discounting” when we have to \\ncalculate the present v alue of money.  \\nWithout getting into the mathematics involved (which by the way is really simple) I \\nwill give you the formula required to calculate the FV and PV.  \\nExample 1  – How much is Rs.5000/ - in today’s terms (2014) worth five years later \\nassuming an o pportunity cost of 8.5%?  \\nThis is a case of Future Value (FV) computation, as we are trying to evaluate the \\nfuture value of the money that we have today – \\nFuture Value = Amount * (1+ opportunity cost rate) ^ Number of years . \\n= 5000 *(1 + 8.5%) ^ 5  \\n= 7518.3  \\nThis means Rs.5000 today is comparable with Rs.7518.3 after 5 years, assuming an \\nopportunity cost of 8.5%.  \\nExample 2  – How much is Rs.10,000/ - receivable after 6 years, worth in today’s \\nterms assuming an opportunity cost of 8.5%?  \\n150', metadata={'source': 'D:/Project/llm/data/Module 3_Fundamental Analysis.pdf', 'page': 150}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='15.1 – The Free Cash Flow (FCF)  \\nThe cash flow that we need to consider for the DCF Analysis is called the “ Free Cash \\nflow (FCF) ” of the company. The free cash flow is basically the  excess operating cash \\nthat the company generates after accounting for capital expenditures such as \\nbuying land, building and equipment. This is the cash that shareholders enjoy after \\naccounting for the capital expenditures. The mark of a healthy business eventually \\ndepends on how much free cash it can generate.  \\nThus, the free cash is the amount of cash the company is left with after it has paid \\nall its expenses including investments.  \\nWhen the company has free cash flows, it indicates the company is a healt hy \\ncompany.   Hence investors often look out of such companies whose share prices \\nare undervalued but who have high or rising free cash flow, as they believe over \\ntime the disparity will disappear as the share price will soon increase.  \\nThus the Free cash fl ow helps us know if the company has generated earnings in a \\nyear or not. Hence as an investor to assess the company’s true financial health, look \\nat the free cash flow besides the earnings.  \\nFCF for any company can be calculated easily by looking at the cas h flow statement. \\nThe formula is – \\nFCF = Cash from Operating Activities – Capital Expenditures  \\nLet us calculate the FCF for the last 3 financial years for ARBL – \\nParticular  2011 -12 2012 -13 2013 -14 \\nCash from Operating Activities (after income tax)  Rs.296.28 Crs  Rs.335.46  Rs.278.7  \\nCapital Expenditures  Rs.86.58  Rs.72.47  Rs.330.3  \\nFree Cash Flow (FCF)  Rs.209.7  Rs.262.99  (Rs.51.6)  \\nHere is the snapshot of ARBL’s FY14 annual report from where you can calculate the \\nfree cash flow – \\n155', metadata={'source': 'D:/Project/llm/data/Module 3_Fundamental Analysis.pdf', 'page': 155}),\n",

The net cash from operating activities is highlighted in green, and the \\ncapital expenditure is highlighted in red.  \\nYou may now have a fair point in your mind  – When the idea is to  calculate the \\nfuture free cash flow, why are we calculating the historical free cash flow? Well, the \\nreason is simple, while working on the DCF model, we need to predict the future \\nfree cash flow. The best way to predict the future free cash flow is by es timating the \\nhistorical average free cash flow and then sequentially growing the free cash flow by \\na certain rate.. This is a standard practice in the industry.  \\nNow, by how much do we grow the free cash flow is the next big question? Well, the \\ngrowth rate you would assume should be as conservative as possible. I personally \\nlike to estimate the FCF for at least 10 years. I do this by growing the cash flow at a \\ncertain rate for the first 5 years, and then I factor in a lower rate for the next five \\nyears. If y ou are getting a little confused here,  I would encourage you to go through \\nthe following step by step calculation for a better clarity.  \\nStep 1  – Estimate the average free cash flow  \\nAs the first step, I estimate the average cash flow for the last 3 years f or ARBL – \\n= 209.7 + 262.99 + (51.6) / 3  \\n=Rs.140.36   Crs \\n156', metadata={'source': 'D:/Project/llm/data/Module 3_Fundamental Analysis.pdf', 'page': 156}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The reason for taking the average cash flow for the last 3 years is to ensure, we are \\naveraging out extreme cash flows, and also accounting for the cyclical nature of the \\nbusiness. For example in case  of ARBL, the latest year cash flow is negative at \\nRs.51.6 Crs. Clearly this is not a true representation of ARBL’s cash flow, hence for \\nthis reason it is always advisable to take the average free cash flow figures.  \\nStep 2  – Identify the growth rate  \\nSelect  a rate which you think is reasonable. This is the rate at which, the average \\ncash flow will grow going forward.  I usually prefer to grow the FCF in 2 stages. The \\nfirst stage deals with the first 5 years and the 2ndstage deals with the last 5 years. \\nSpeci fically with reference to ARBL, I prefer to use 18% for the first 5 years and \\naround 10% for the next five years.

A company is expected to be a ‘going concern’ which continues to exist forever. \\nThis also means as long as the company exists, there is some amount of free cash \\nbeing generated.  However as companies mature, the rate at which the free cash is \\ngenerated starts to diminish.  \\nThe rate at which the free cash flow grows beyond 10 years (2024 onwards) is called \\nthe “ Terminal Growth Rate ”.

The free cash flow tracks the money left over for the investors  \\n3. The latest year FCF is used to f orecast the future year’s cash flow  \\n4. The growth rate at which the FCF is grown has to be conservative  \\n5. Terminal growth rate is the rate at which the company’s cash flow is supposed to \\ngrow beyond the terminal year  \\n6. The terminal value is the value of the cash flow the company generates from the \\nterminal year upto infinity  \\n7. The future cash flow including the terminal value has to be discounted back to \\ntoday’s value  \\n8.

       " Document(page_content='Module 3  — Fundamental Analysis  \\nChapter 16  \\nThe Finale  \\n161 \\n \\n16.1 – The follies of DCF Analysis  \\nIn this concluding chapter, we will discuss a few important  topics that could \\nsignificantly impact the way you make your investment decisions. In the previous \\nchapter, we learnt about the intrinsic value calculation using the Discounted Cash \\nFlow (DCF) analysis. The DCF method is probably one of the most reliable methods \\navailable to evaluate the intrinsic value of a company’s stock. However, the DCF \\nmethod has its fair share of drawbacks which you need to be aware of. The DCF \\nmodel is only as good as the assumptions which are fed to it. If the assumptions \\nused are  incorrect, the fair value and stock price computation could be skewed.  \\n1. DCF requires us to forecast  – To begin with, the DCF model requires us to predict \\nthe future cash flow and the business cycles. This is a challenge, let alone for a \\nfundamental analyst  but also for the top management of the company  \\n2. Highly sensitive to the Terminal Growth rate  – The DCF model is highly sensitive \\nto the terminal growth rate. A small change in the terminal growth rate would lead \\nto a large difference in the final output i. e. the per share value. For instance in the \\nARBL case, we have assumed 3.5% as the terminal growth rate. At 3.5%, the share \\nprice is Rs.368/ - but if we change this to 4.0% (an increase of 50 basis points) the \\nshare price would change to Rs.394/ - \\n166', metadata={'source': 'D:/Project/llm/data/Module 3_Fundamental Analysis.pdf', 'page': 166}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='3. Constant U pdates  – Once the model is built, the analyst needs to constantly modify \\nand align the model with new data (quarterly and yearly data) that comes in. Both \\nthe inputs and the assumptions of the DCF model needs to be updated on a regular \\nbasis.  \\n4. Long term foc us – DCF is heavily focused on long term investing, and thus it does \\nnot offer anything to investors who have a short term focus. (i.e. 1 year investment \\nhorizon)  \\nAlso, the DCF model may make you miss out on unusual opportunities as the model \\nare based on certain rigid parameters.  \\nHaving stated the above, the only way to overcome the drawbacks of the DCF Model \\nis by being as conservative as possible while making the assumptions. Some \\nguidelines for the conservative assumptions are – \\n1. FCF (Free Cash Flow) gro wth rate  – The rate at which you grow the FCF year on \\nyear has to be around 20%. Companies can barely sustain growing their free cash \\nflow beyond 20%. If a company is young and belongs to the high growth sector, then \\nprobably a little under 20% is justifie d, but no company deserves a FCF growth rate \\nof over 20%  \\n2. Number of years  – This is a bit tricky, while longer the duration, the better it is. At \\nthe same time longer the duration, there would be more room for errors. I generally \\nprefer to use a 10 year 2 s tage DCF approach  \\n3. 2 stage DCF valuation  – It is always a good practice to split the DCF analysis into 2 \\nstages as demonstrated in the ARBL example in the previous chapter. As discussed \\n,In stage 1 I would grow the FCF at a certain rate, and in stage 2 I wo uld grow the \\nFCF at a rate lower than the one used in stage 1  \\n4. Terminal Growth Rate  – As I had mentioned earlier, the DCF model is highly \\nsensitive to the terminal growth rate. Simple thumb rule here – keep it as low as \\npossible. I personally prefer to keep  it around 4% and never beyond it.  \\n16.2 – Margin of Safety  \\nNow, despite making some conservative assumptions things could still go wrong. \\nHow do you insulate yourself against that? This is where the concept of ‘Margin of \\nSafety’ would arrive. The margin of  safety thought process was popularized by \\nBenjamin Graham in his seminal book titled “Intelligent Investor”. The ‘margin of \\nsafety’ simply suggests that an investor should buy stocks only when it is available at \\na discount to the estimated intrinsic value  calculation. Following the Margin of \\nSafety does not imply successful investments, but would provide a buffer for errors \\nin calculation.  \\nHere is how I exercise the ‘Margin of Safety’ principle in my own investment practice. \\nConsider the case of Amara Raja  Batteries Limited; the intrinsic value estimate was \\naround Rs.368/ - per share. Further we applied a 10% modeling error to create the \\n167', metadata={'source': 'D:/Project/llm/data/Module 3_Fundamental Analysis.pdf', 'page': 167}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='intrinsic value band. The lower intrinsic value estimate was Rs.331/ -. At Rs.331/ - we \\nare factoring in modeling errors. Th e Margin of Safety advocates us to further \\ndiscount the intrinsic value. I usually like to discount the intrinsic value by another \\n30% at least.  \\nBut why should we discount it further? Aren’t we being extra conservative you may \\nask? Well, yes, but this is t he only way you can insulate yourself from the bad \\nassumptions and bad luck. Think about it, given all the fundamentals, if a stock \\nlooks attractive at Rs.100, then at Rs.70, you can be certain it is indeed a good bet! \\nThis is in fact what the savvy value investors always practice.  \\nGoing back to the case of ARBL – \\n1. Intrinsic value is Rs.368/ - \\n2. Accounting for modeling errors @10% the lower intrinsic band value is Rs.331/ - \\n3. Discounting it further by another 30%, in order to accommodate for the margin of \\nsafety, the intrinsic value would be around Rs.230/ - \\n4. At 230/ - I would be a buyer in this stock with great conviction  \\nOf course, when quality stocks falls way below its intrinsic value they get picked up \\nby value investors. Hence when the margin of safety is at play, you should consider \\nbuying it as soon as you can. As a long term investor, sweet deals like this (as in a \\nquality stock trading below its intrinsic value) should not be missed.  \\nAlso, remember good stocks will be available at great discounts mostly in  a bear \\nmarket, when people are extremely pessimistic about stocks. So make sure you \\nhave sufficient cash during bear markets to go shopping!  \\n16.3 – When to sell?  \\nThroughout the module we have discussed about buying stocks. But what about \\nselling? When do we book profits? For instance assume you bought ARBL at around \\nRs.250 per share. It is now trading close to Rs.730/ - per share. This translates to an \\nabsolute return of 192%. A great rate of return by any yardstick (considering the \\nreturn is generated in o ver a year’s time). So does that mean you actually sell out \\nthis stock and book a profit? Well the decision to sell depends on the disruption in \\ninvestible grade attributes.  \\nDisruption in investible grade attributes  – Remember the decision to buy the \\nstock  does not stem from the price at which the stock trades. Meaning, we do not \\nbuy ARBL just because it has declined by 15%. We buy ARBL only because it qualifies \\nthrough the rigor of  the“investible grade attributes”. If a stock does not showcase \\ninvestible grade attributes we do not buy. Therefore going by that logic, we hold on \\nto stocks as long as the investible grade attributes stays intact.  \\n168', metadata={'source': 'D:/Project/llm/data/Module 3_Fundamental Analysis.pdf', 'page': 168}),\n",

However if you \\nhave the patience to stay put, markets can reward you fairly well. When I say \\n“reward you fairly wel l” I have a CAGR of about 15 -18% in mind. I personally think \\nthis is a fairly decent and realistic expectation. Please don’t be swayed by abnormal \\nreturns like 50 - 100% in the short term, even if it is achievable it may not be \\nsustainable  \\n2. Long term approac h – I have discussed this topic in chapter 2 as to why investors \\nneed to have a long term approach. Remember, money compounds faster the \\nlonger you stay invested  \\n3.

One example that I distinctly remember \\nwas that of Cox & Kings. You may know that Cox & Kings is one of the largest and \\nthe oldest tour operator in India. In late 2013, the company announced inclusion of \\nMr.Keki Mis try (from HDFC Bank) to its advisory board. Corporate India has an \\nimmense respect for him as he is known to be a very transparent and efficient \\nbusiness professional. A colleague of mine was convinced that Cox & Kings would \\nbenefit significantly with Mr. Keki Mistry on its board. This alone acted as a primary \\ntrigger for my colleague to investigate the stock further. Upon further research my \\ncolleague happily invested in Cox & Kings Limited. Good for my him, as I write this \\ntoday I know he is sitting on a 200% gain  \\n6. Circle of Competence – This is where you leverage your professional skills to \\nidentify stock ideas. This is a highly recommended technique for a newbie investor. \\nThis method requires you to identify stocks within your professional domain. For \\nexample, if you are a medical professional your circle of competence would be the \\nhealthcare industry. You will probably be a better person to understand that \\nindustry than a stock broker or an equity research analyst. All you need to do is \\nidentify which are  the listed companies in this space and pick the best based on \\nyour assessment. Likewise if you are banker, you will probably know more about \\nbanks than the others do. So, leverage your circle of competence to pick your \\ninvestments.  \\nThe point is that the t rigger for investigating stocks may come from any source. In \\nfact, as and when you feel a particular stock looks interesting, just add it to your list. \\nThis list over time will be your ‘watch list’. A very important thing to note here is that \\na stock may n ot satisfy the checklist items at a particular time, however as the time \\n129', metadata={'page': 129.0, 'source': 'D:/Project/llm/data/Module 3_Fundamental Analysis.pdf'}),\n",

Cut the noise, apply the checklist  – No matter how much the analyst on \\nTV/newspaper brags about a certain company don’t fall prey to it. You have a \\nchecklist, just apply the same to see if it makes any sense  \\n6. Respect the margin of  safety  – As this literally works like a safety net against bad \\nluck \\n7. IPO’s  – Avoid buying into IPOs. IPOs are usually overpriced. However if you were \\ncompelled to buy into an IPO then analyze the IPO in the same 3 stage equity \\nresearch methodology  \\n8.

Always \\nlook at learning new things and exploring your knowledge base.  \\nI would like to leave you with 4 book recommendations that I think will help you \\ndevelop a great investment mindset.  \\n1.
