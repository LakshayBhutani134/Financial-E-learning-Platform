1, Introduction to Stock Markets, Let's break down the finance jargon and dive into why investing matters. Imagine you're earning Rs.50000 a month spending Rs.30000 on essentials leaving Rs.20000 untouched. Fast forward 20 years: without investing, you'd have Rs.1.7 crores but if you invest that Rs.20000 monthly at 12% you could retire with over Rs.4.26 crores – more than double! So why invest? It's about securing your future and reaching your dreams. But where to start? Here are some options: Fixed Income: Like bank FDs or bonds they're safe but offer modest returns around 5-10%. Equities: Buying shares of companies can give higher returns but they come with more risk averaging around 12-15%. Real Estate: Buying property can be profitable but it requires a lot of money and isn't easy to sell quickly. Commodities: Like gold and silver they're safer but offer lower returns around 5-8%. When investing remember:Risk and return are connected – higher risk can mean higher returns.Choose investments based on your risk tolerance and goals.Diversify your portfolio to spread risk.Now you're ready to start your investment journey and secure your financial future!,In the previous chapter we discussed the importance of investing in equities. Now let's dive into how to actually get started in the stock market. But before that let's understand the market ecosystem and its key players.Imagine the stock market as your online shopping platform for investments. Instead of brick-and-mortar stores it's all digital. In India we have two main players: the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE). These platforms connect buyers and sellers of shares.Market participants include individuals corporations and institutions. Everyone's aim? Making profitable transactions. But with money involved emotions like greed and fear come into play. That's where regulation comes in.Meet SEBI the Securities and Exchange Board of India. Their job? Ensuring fair play in the markets. From regulating stock exchanges to overseeing brokers and protecting investors' interests SEBI keeps the market in check.Now let's look at some key market entities and what they do:Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) assess the creditworthiness of companies and governments.Debenture Trustees oversee corporate debentures to ensure obligations are met.Depositories like NSDL and CDSL keep your securities safe and facilitate trading.Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) are foreign entities investing in India impacting market sentiment.Asset Management Companies (AMCs) manage mutual fund schemes to grow investors' money.Stock Brokers like Zerodha and Sharekhan provide electronic access to the stock markets for investors.Remember SEBI keeps an eye on everyone so play fair! Now you're ready to navigate the exciting world of the stock market. , Many corporate entities work in tandem to ensure transactions in the market flow smoothly. Right from the time you log in to a trading terminal (let’s say to buy shares) to the time these shares hit your DEMAT account market intermediaries work seamlessly together to ensure your transactions flow without any hiccups.,Corporate entities collaborate to ensure seamless transactions in the market. From logging into a trading terminal to shares reaching your DEMAT account market intermediaries work silently adhering to SEBI rules ensuring smooth transactions. These entities also known as financial intermediaries create the market ecosystem., Let's delve into a few key intermediaries: The Stock Broker: Your market gateway facilitating investments in stocks bonds ETFs and Mutual funds. With SEBI's approval brokers provide access to trading platforms like Zerodha's 'Kite' offering various services like trade execution support and reporting. Depository and Depository Participants: Post the Harshad Mehta saga share certificates went digital. Depositories like NSDL and CDSL manage your DEMAT account acting as digital vaults for shares. Brokers link your trading and DEMAT accounts simplifying transactions.Banks: Facilitate fund transfers between your bank and trading accounts. Linked accounts ensure smooth withdrawals and dividend payments. Brokers verify and manage these accounts for seamless trading experiences.NSE Clearing Limited and ICCL: Ensure guaranteed settlement of trades avoiding defaults. While you might not interact directly with them they play vital roles in the clearing process ensuring efficient trade execution.,Understanding these intermediaries is crucial for navigating the market ecosystem. From brokers providing market access to depositories safeguarding shares and clearing corporations settling trades each entity contributes to a seamless trading experience.Understanding why companies go public is pivotal in grasping fundamental market concepts. Chapters four and five explore this shedding light on financial concepts along the way. Let's dive into the story:Scene 1: The Angels::An entrepreneur pitches a unique business idea to friends raising seed funds to kickstart operations.Scene 2: The Venture Capitalist::As the business grows a Venture Capitalist injects capital for expansion leading to higher valuations and profits.Scene 3: The Banker::With success the company seeks further expansion. It funds capital expenditure through profits VC funding and bank loans.Scene 4: The Private Equity :: As ambitions soar Private Equity firms step in investing in larger capital expenditures steering the company's growth. Scene 5: The IPO::Years later the company aims for global expansion. To fund this it goes public offering shares to the public for the first time raising capital for further growth. These scenes elucidate the evolution of a company's funding journey from angel investments to IPOs. Key Takeaways: Angel investors provide seed funds taking on high risks akin to the entrepreneur. Series A B and C funding stages reflect the company's growth with higher valuations. Private Equity firms invest in mature companies guiding their expansion with substantial capital. An IPO marks a company's transition to the public domain raising funds for extensive growth plans. Through this journey companies navigate various funding avenues each contributing to their success story. ,In the previous chapter. we saw a company's journey to IPO and various funding options. Chapter 5 delves into IPO processes crucial for new investors. Understanding IPO circumstances is vital as it attracts first-time investors. Reasons for going public include funding CAPEX. reducing debt. and providing exits for early investors. Merchant bankers play a pivotal role in conducting due diligence. preparing documents. and underwriting shares. The IPO sequence involves SEBI approval. preparing DRHP. marketing. fixing price bands. book building. and listing. After an IPO. stocks transition to the secondary market for daily trading. Understanding IPO jargon like oversubscription. green shoe option. and price bands is crucial for investors. Key takeaways emphasize reasons for going public. the role of merchant bankers. SEBI's regulatory oversight. and the importance of reading DRHP. Most IPOs in India follow a book-building process. underscoring the need for investor awareness.  Understanding the IPO process and the reasons behind companies offering shares to the public we now delve into the stock markets further. Once a company goes public it discloses all information to the public and its shares are traded daily on stock exchanges. Market participants trade stocks for various reasons shaping the stock market. The stock market serves as an electronic marketplace where buyers and sellers express their trade viewpoints. News and events significantly influence stock prices driving market movements. After buying shares they reside in your DEMAT account entitling you to corporate benefits. The holding period varies from minutes to years defining your role as a trader or investor. Different types of traders and investors have distinct approaches based on their risk tolerance and holding duration., https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2023/05/29/1600x900/Nifty_1669509049999_1685353797332.jpg
2, Futures trading,The Futures market is a crucial part of the Financial Derivatives world where securities derive their value from another financial entity known as an Underlying Asset which can be stocks bonds commodities or currencies Dating back to 320 BC in Kautilya's Arthashastra derivatives have historical roots describing pricing mechanisms for future harvests Understanding the Forwards market provides a basis for grasping the Futures market Forwards contracts akin to older versions of futures involve agreements between buyers and sellers to exchange goods for cash at a predetermined price and date commonly used to hedge against adverse price movements, For instance in a typical forwards agreement between a jeweler and a gold importer the parties fix a price for gold to be delivered in the future based on their contrasting views on future price movements Potential scenarios illustrate how price fluctuations impact both parties leading to either profits or losses Settlement options include physical delivery or cash settlement Despite their simplicity forwards contracts entail risks such as liquidity default and regulatory uncertainties leading to the development of futures contracts aimed at mitigating these risks ,Thus while the Futures market forms a dynamic component of the Financial Derivatives Market understanding the foundational concepts of forwards contracts is essential for navigating this domain effectively , In the previous chapter we delved into the futures market emphasizing the primary goal of traders: financial gain based on directional views of asset prices. Now let's transition to a practical example using stocks stepping away from gold., On December 15 2014 Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) announced cautious revenue growth expectations for the December Quarter causing its stock to drop over 3.6%. As a trader I view this drop as exaggerated due to predictable seasonal trends. Believing the stock will eventually rise I take a bullish stance on TCS. Rather than purchasing TCS shares directly I opt for TCS Futures., By analyzing the Futures price which mirrors the spot price I determine my entry point. Despite initial differences in spot and Futures prices they align closely. Examining the Futures contract details I understand key elements such as lot size contract value and expiry date. With this knowledge I execute a buy order for TCS Futures. Upon purchase several background processes occur seamlessly: margin validation counterparty matching digital agreement signing and margin blocking. Now owning 1 lot of TCS Futures I anticipate three post-agreement scenarios: stock price rise fall or stagnation. Each scenario entails profit or loss implications for both buyer and seller. Following the agreement I track TCS's performance. On December 16 2014 the stock price surges yielding a significant profit for me. Opting to square off my position at Rs. 2460/- I transfer the Futures contract to another party realizing my gains. However had I held the contract until its December 24 2014 expiry I could have potentially earned even higher profits. This example underscores key takeaways: the potential for financial gain based on directional views the necessity of margin deposits the digital nature of Futures agreements and the fluidity of exiting positions through square-offs transferring risk to another party. In Futures trading gains for one party equate to losses for the other highlighting the dynamic nature of this market., Leverage is often overlooked in everyday life but it's a critical concept to grasp. Let's take a real estate example: a friend buys a property by paying just 10% upfront with the rest due as construction progresses. When the property's value rises he sells it earning a profit much larger than his initial investment. This type of transaction where a small investment controls a larger asset exemplifies leverage. Now let's apply this concept to trading futures., Imagine buying TCS stock at Rs.2362/share on December 15 2014 and selling it for Rs.2519/share on December 23 2014. With Rs.100000 in hand you have two options: buy TCS stock directly or buy TCS futures. In the spot market you'd buy 42 shares earning a 5.79% return over 9 days. In the futures market with just Rs.41335 as margin you could buy 2 lots of TCS futures yielding a 47% return over the same period. The difference is striking. But leverage comes with risks. A higher leverage ratio means higher potential returns but also higher risk. For instance at 7.14 times leverage a 14% drop in TCS stock could wipe out your margin deposit. So while leverage can magnify profits it also amplifies losses. In futures trading every price movement affects your profit or loss. The payoff structure shows how your profit or loss changes at different price points. It's a linear relationship: a rise in price means profit while a drop means loss. Understanding leverage is essential in futures trading. It allows you to control larger positions with less capital but it also increases risk. Futures trading is essentially a zero-sum game: profits made by one party are losses for another. And while it offers the potential for significant gains it's crucial to manage leverage wisely to avoid substantial losses. , https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:768/1*2Mr7lOssU4YrNx8RAud9Lg.png
3, Options Theory for Professional Trading, The options market dominates derivatives especially in India where about 80% of trades involve options. Internationally options date back to the 1920s evolving from OTC deals to exchange-traded contracts by the 1980s. In India the derivative market began with index futures in 2000 followed by index and stock options in 2001 and single stock futures in 2001. Liquidity surged in 2006 due to corporate events like the Ambani split enhancing market vibrancy. Ajay and Venu's land deal illustrates options. Ajay pays Venu upfront to lock in a land purchase price giving him the right to buy in 6 months., Three outcomes follow: land value rises falls or remains. Ajay benefits if the value rises loses his fee otherwise. The deal resembles a call option. Applying this to stocks imagine having the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future. If the stock price surpasses this you profit otherwise you lose the premium paid., Options contracts hinge on whether the stock price rises falls or stagnates. Variables like the underlying asset expiry date reference price and premium characterize options contracts. The buyer has the right the seller the obligation to execute the contract. The buyer pays a premium agreed upon at initiation. Options offer a hedge against risk particularly in uncertain markets., In the next chapter we'll delve deeper into call options exploring finer details of this versatile financial tool. Buy a call option when anticipating an asset price increase. The strike price is the agreed-upon anchor price., Exercising an option means claiming the right to buy at expiry. Options expire monthly with different contracts available. Premiums vary based on multiple factors. Buyer's maximum loss is the premium paid. Unlimited profit potential if the spot price exceeds the strike. Breakeven point is when the premium is recovered., Selling a call option is bearish with profit limited to the premium. P&L = Premium - Max(0 Spot Price - Strike). Breakdown point = Strike + Premium. Indian options are European style., Buy a put option when bearish profitable if the underlying declines. IV (Put Option) = Strike - Spot Price. Put Option buyer's P&L = Max(0 Strike - Spot) - Premium. Put option buyer's breakeven = Strike - Premium., Put option sellers profit when the spot price is at or above the strike price indicating a bullish outlook.Selling a put option depends on the attractiveness of the premium compared to buying a call option. Understanding option pricing and Greeks helps assess premium attractiveness. Put option buyers and sellers have opposite P&L behavior. Selling a put option involves receiving a premium and requires margin deposit. Profit is limited to the premium received with potentially unlimited losses. P&L = Premium received - Max(0 Strike Price - Spot Price). Breakdown point = Strike Price - Premium received., https://diplomatist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Amazing-Ways-to-Become-a-Professional-Trader.jpg
4, Option Strategies , Spread strategies some of the simplest options tactics involve multiple legs and are best suited for moderate market outlooks For instance a Bull Call Spread is effective when anticipating a moderately bullish or bearish trend Various scenarios like fundamental technical or quantitative perspectives can lead to a moderate outlook By employing spread strategies traders aim to limit downside risk while capping potential profits allowing participation in the market at reduced costs The Bull Call Spread a popular two-legged strategy involves buying an at-the-money ATM call option and selling an out-of-the-money OTM call option The net debit transaction in this spread referred to as a "debit bull spread" ensures predefined losses and profits Strike selection is crucial often determined by volatility and time to expiry Wide spreads offer higher potential gains but increase breakeven levels Careful consideration of risk-reward ratios and understanding of Greeks especially Theta are essential in spread strategy implementation . , Bull Put Spread is suitable for moderately bullish market views. It results in a net credit. Optimal execution occurs in scenarios of high put premiums elevated volatility and a market poised for a rebound. Strategy involves buying an OTM Put and selling an ITM Put. Maximum profit is limited to the net credit received while maximum loss is capped at the difference between the spread and the net credit. Breakeven is calculated as Higher Strike minus Net Credit., Strike selection influences the risk-reward ratio with wider spreads offering higher profit potential. ,The Call Ratio Back Spread is a compelling options strategy for those with a bullish outlook on a stock or index. It offers unlimited profit potential if the market rises limited profit if it falls and a predefined loss if it stays within a range., This strategy involves selling one ITM call option and buying two OTM call options in a 2:1 ratio.When implemented for a net credit the strategy can yield profits even if the market moves in either direction. Selling the ITM call option generates income if the market moves down while buying two OTM call options allows for unlimited profit potential if the market moves up., This versatility makes the Call Ratio Back Spread an attractive alternative to plain vanilla call options.To execute this strategy traders need to ensure the options belong to the same expiry and underlying and maintain the 2:1 ratio. For example selling one lot of an ITM call option and buying two lots of OTM call options results in a net credit transaction.,The strategy's payoff varies at different levels of market expiry showcasing its flexibility. Breakeven points are crucial markers with the lower breakeven at the lower strike plus the net credit and the upper breakeven at the higher strike plus the maximum loss.Regardless of the time to expiry selecting slightly ITM and slightly OTM strikes is optimal. Volatility also plays a role with higher volatility benefiting the strategy when there is ample time to expiry but potentially harming it as expiry approaches.Key takeaways:Best suited for bullish market outlooks,Involves selling one ITM call option and buying two OTM call options.Typically executed for a net credit.Offers unlimited profit potential if the market rises and limited profit if it falls.Predefined loss and two breakeven points.Optimal strike selection is crucial.Volatility's impact varies depending on the time to expiry with higher volatility generally beneficial with more time to expiry but potentially harmful with less time remaining., https://www.stockpathshala.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/learn-option-strategies.jpg
5, Markets and Taxation , India needs help from all of us countrymen in developing a tax culture. Fear of the income tax department can only be alleviated by understanding basic rules and regulations. Income tax rates have reduced significantly over the years but apathy towards filing returns persists., With the IT department's sophisticated systems repercussions for non-compliance are increasing. They have access to bank account details and can monitor capital market activity through PAN. As Aadhar gets linked everywhere consolidated income and expense statements may become common, Understanding taxation especially for trading and investing is essential. Many people including Chartered Accountants struggle with it. Simplifying taxation concepts is crucial and this module aims to do just that, Income tax is a levy on earnings supporting government responsibilities like healthcare and defense. Everyone earning above the minimum slab must pay taxes, However only a small fraction of Indians file returns and pay taxes due to a lack of tax culture. Taxation is based on annual income with the financial year running from April 1st to March 31st. Tax slabs vary with age groups and there are options to claim rebates and deductions. The introduction of a new tax regime provides more flexibility. In the next chapter we'll delve into taxation details for trading and investing, It's essential to file correct returns considering the IT department's access to market activity. Only about 5% of Indians file returns emphasizing the need for better tax awareness. , Updated on March 2 2016 the income tax department clarified classification for traders and investors through a CBDT circular. Individuals can choose to categorize stock investments as capital gains or business income with the chosen classification remaining consistent in subsequent years. Before filing tax returns individuals must classify themselves as investors traders or both. Understanding these classifications is essential for tax compliance. Broadly income from trading or investing falls into four categories:Long term capital gain (LTCG)..Short term capital gain (STCG)..Speculative business income..Non-speculative business income..Long term capital gain (LTCG) applies to profits earned from stocks or equity mutual funds held for over a year. Until FY 2017/18 LTCG was entirely exempt from tax. However from FY 2018/19 gains exceeding Rs 1 lakh are taxed at 10%.Short term capital gain (STCG) arises from selling listed stocks or equity mutual funds within a year of purchase. STCG is taxed at a flat rate of 15%. Speculative business income includes profits from intraday trading or non-delivery trading. Tax rates are determined by the taxpayer's income slab. Non-speculative business income encompasses trading futures and options on recognized exchanges, Taxes are calculated based on the taxpayer's overall income slab. Declaring trading as business income has advantages such as tax deductions for business expenses and offsetting losses with gains. However it may result in higher taxes and additional compliance requirements like audits. CBDT distinguishes between traders and investors. Investors earn through dividends while traders profit from price fluctuations. F&O trading is considered non-speculative business while intraday equity trading is speculative. Individuals can be both traders and investors simultaneously. However consistency in classification is crucial for tax filing. Consulting a chartered accountant before filing returns is advisable. Understanding these classifications and consulting with tax professionals ensures accurate tax compliance for retail investors and traders. In continuation of the previous chapter: Classifying your market activity if you buy and sell stocks after taking delivery to your DEMAT account you can consider yourself an investor. However if the frequency of transactions (buy/sells) is high it's best to consider them as trades rather than investments. This classification affects whether the income is considered non-speculative business income or capital gains. There's no set rule from the IT department to quantify 'frequency' or determine 'long term' but consistency across financial years is key. For equity delivery-based trades gains from stocks held for over a year qualify as long term capital gains (LTCG) taxed at 0% for the first Rs 1 lakh and 10% thereafter. Shorter-term trades are considered short term capital gains (STCG) taxed at 15%. Equity mutual funds follow similar taxation rules.  Indexation is used to calculate the true value of assets after considering inflation reducing the tax burden on long term capital gains. It's calculated using the Cost Inflation Index (CII). Understanding the difference between LTCG and STCG is essential for investors as the tax rates vary significantly. Short term capital losses can be carried forward for up to 8 years and set off against gains in subsequent years providing tax-saving opportunities. Consulting a chartered accountant (CA) before filing returns is advisable as tax rules can be complex and subject to change., https://marketfeed.gumlet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Editorial-Taxes-_05-05-21-01.png?w=730
6, Personal Finance - Mutual Funds , When it comes to personal finance mastering the underlying math is essential. Understanding simple interest is fundamental where interest is calculated only on the principal amount. For instance if you lend Rs.100000 at 10% interest for 5 years you'd earn Rs.50000 in total interest. In contrast compound interest involves interest on both the principal and previous interest earned. Using the same example with compound interest compounded annually you'd earn Rs.161051 over 5 years. This compounding effect where gains are reinvested magnifies returns over time. Similarly understanding returns is crucial with absolute return for investments under a year and compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for longer-term investments, Compounding works best when investments are given sufficient time to grow. In considering a hypothetical scenario where a friend offers two options—receiving Rs.10000 immediately or in two years—most would likely choose the latter. This decision reflects the time value of money, a core concept in finance, Money today can be invested to grow increasing its value over time. Understanding present and future value is crucial for making informed financial decisions.The present value of money is its current worth considering its potential future growth. This concept is illustrated by calculating what a future sum such as Rs.75000000 in 15 years is worth today, Using a discount rate—often the risk-free rate plus a premium—the present value is determined.Conversely the future value of money calculates what a present sum will grow to over time. For instance, Rs.20590353 today could grow to Rs.75000000 in 15 years when compounded at the opportunity cost rate These concepts can guide various decisions such as whether to accept immediate payment or delay for a larger sum. Evaluating real-life situations like saving for education expenses or considering investment opportunities involves applying the time value of money principles to assess present and future value effectively. , Success in personal finance can be distilled into three key factors: understanding the numbers embracing risk and exercising common sense. These foundational elements set the stage for navigating the complexities of financial decisions.Understanding the numbers involves grasping concepts like present and future value which lay the groundwork for making informed choices. Meanwhile embracing risk entails continuously expanding knowledge to effectively manage risk and seize opportunities for growth Lastly common sense serves as a guiding principle across various aspects of life including finance.To embark on a journey of personal finance it's essential to tackle real-life financial problems. For instance planning for retirement requires addressing two main aspects: determining the required retirement corpus and devising strategies to accumulate it Considering a hypothetical scenario where an individual aims to maintain a consistent lifestyle post-retirement the challenge lies in estimating the future value of money due to inflation. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of money over time necessitating a comprehensive approach to retirement planning.By employing the future value formula and accounting for inflation individuals can estimate the corpus required at the beginning of retirement. This process reveals the substantial amount needed to sustain a desired lifestyle over the retirement period.However it's important to acknowledge potential oversimplifications in such calculations such as assuming a constant monthly expense or overlooking changes in lifestyle preferences with age. Nonetheless taking a conservative approach in financial planning ensures preparedness for various scenarios. In the next chapter strategies for generating retirement income will be explored building upon the foundational understanding of present and future value concepts. , We're now at an exciting juncture. In the previous chapter we estimated the retirement corpus needed for a comfortable post-retirement lifestyle though with some conservative assumptions. While our estimate may have overlooked certain factors it serves as a foundation for our journey into personal finance mastery.  Our focus now shifts to the technique of generating this corpus. It's evident that creating the retirement fund requires investments starting today. Ideally these investments should span across various assets forming a diversified portfolio.Consider a hypothetical distribution of assets: 50% real estate 10% fixed deposit 10% gold 15% equities and 15% cash. Each asset grows at different rates and our goal is to determine the overall growth of this portfolio.Assigning growth expectations for each asset such as 8-10% for real estate and 10-11% for equities allows us to calculate the combined portfolio growth which in this example is 8.25%.However for the retirement problem we simplify our approach by focusing solely on equities particularly through systematic investments in equity mutual funds. Assuming a conservative 10-11% growth rate for equities over the long term we delve into building the retirement corpus.Starting with the assumption of a steady job regular salary and yearly pay hikes we increase investments in equity mutual funds by 10% annually. This systematic investment strategy over 25 years aims to accumulate the desired retirement corpus.Employing the future value of money concept we calculate the future worth of monthly investments at the assumed growth rate. However initial estimates fall short of the target corpus prompting considerations for increasing savings rates or extending investment periods. While saving substantial amounts monthly may seem daunting especially for those starting their careers the long runway before retirement offers a powerful lever: time. Starting with smaller amounts and gradually increasing investments can yield similar results over time. For individuals closer to retirement saving larger chunks of their income becomes imperative. Nonetheless this discussion serves as a simplified starting point acknowledging the various complexities and possibilities in personal finance. Moving forward we'll delve into mutual fund investments understanding their nuances and exploring other essential components of personal finance like insurance and pension funds. With a long learning path ahead we're poised to navigate the intricacies of financial planning. The chapter on the retirement problem sets the stage for understanding personal finance. It emphasizes the necessity of long-term mutual fund investments to build a retirement corpus. Given mutual funds crucial role in financial well-being delving deeper into their workings becomes essential. The discussion covers various topics including:Mutual Fund Basics: Defining mutual funds and their significance.Fund Management Journey: Narrating a personal story highlighting the evolution from trading to investing resembling a fund manager's role.Understanding AMC Structure: Deconstructing the structure of an Asset Management Company (AMC) and its components like sponsors trustees AMC custodian and RTA.Key Takeaways: Summarizing the chapter's main points emphasizing the fund manager's role the significance of sponsors and the AMC's responsibilities.This comprehensive overview aims to equip readers with a deeper understanding of mutual funds beyond typical investor knowledge setting the stage for further exploration into personal finance.,https://napkinfinance.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/mutualfunds.jpg
7, Social Stock Exchanges (SSEs), We often feel compelled to assist the less fortunate but struggle to identify trustworthy organizations to support. Enter the Social Stock Exchange (SSE) bridging the gap between well-intentioned donors and genuine social enterprises.,What exactly is an SSE? It's a platform akin to a traditional stock exchange where social enterprises—both for-profit and not-for-profit—can raise funds publicly. In India SSEs will operate as segments on existing stock exchanges like BSE and NSE.,The SSE facilitates fundraising through various instruments including ZCZP securities a novel concept where investors essentially donate funds with no monetary returns. While SSEs promise social impact quantifying these returns remains a challenge.Regulated by SEBI SSEs require NPOs to publish an Annual Impact Report audited by Social Impact Assessors., Governing bodies oversee SSE operations ensuring transparency and accountability.As SSEs evolve our understanding will too., In the next chapter we'll delve into eligibility criteria for listing on SSEs.Key Takeaways:SSEs connect donors with genuine social enterprises.Both for-profit and not-for-profit organizations can list on SSEs.,NPOs primarily use ZCZP securities for fundraising.Social impact assessment and transparency are central to SSE operations. , Now that we've grasped the concept of a social stock exchange let's explore which entities qualify for this platform.Social stock exchanges revolutionize fundraising offering a wider donor base and ensuring transparency for investors. As per SEBI both non-profit organizations (NPOs) and for-profit social enterprises (FPEs) are eligible for listing.NPOs must demonstrate social intent serving underserved populations and derive two-thirds of their revenue from welfare activities. They need to exist for three years and meet certain fundraising and spending thresholds.FPEs akin to traditional commercial entities can list on various platforms like the main board or SME platform.Entities ineligible for SSE include political/religious organizations professional associations and corporate groups primarily funded by parent companies.NPOs undergo a registration process unlike FPEs which can directly list securities., Registration fosters governance and transparency though it entails compliance costs.Once onboarded both NPOs and FPEs can raise funds using diverse instruments like ZCZP bonds mutual fund donations and development impact bonds.Key Takeaways:SSE requires entities to demonstrate social intent.NPOs must register before fundraising with a validity of 12 months.FPEs can list directly on various platforms.Registration enhances governance and transparency.Various fundraising instruments are available for listed entities., https://www.livelaw.in/h-upload/2022/08/24/431933-social-stock-exchange.jpg
